# OpenGL Exercices

## Introduction
This project is a resolution of the exercices given to us in order to learn OpenGL. It was divided in `5 part` :

- Basic shape realisation
- Moving the scene camera
- Adding texture to objects
- Light management
- Creation of a Maze

## How to use

Simply type the command `make` in the terminal, then `./Maze`

## Difficulties 

It was hard to manipulate/experiment freely when you don't understand a huge part of the code.

Finding help/documentation online is also very hard since most of the problems people meet on forums are way out of our league.

I also didn't git my project much, which is a habit I need to establish.
